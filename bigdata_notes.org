** Operators
1) Map
   - Input = (key,value) --> (key, <v>)
2) Reduce
   - Operates share a key
   - (key,value) is sorted and values passed to reducer

** Failures and Slowdowns
- Handled by the master
*** Possible failures
1) Map / Reduce
   - Worker fails, some maps and some reduces completed
   - Reduce data is already written to HDFS, doesn't need to be recomputed
   - Maps must be re-executed to recover intermediate data, since it hasn't been written to HDFS
